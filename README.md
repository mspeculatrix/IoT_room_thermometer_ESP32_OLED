# IoT_room_thermometer_ESP32_OLED

ESP32-based IoT room thermometer with InfluxDB client & OLED display.

A blog post on this is in progress.

Open source - have at it!
  
This code comes with no guarantees or promises. Don't blame me if it burns your house down.

For a TTGO ESP32 dev board with 128x64 OLED display.
 
Uses a GY-21 (SHT21/HTU21) I2C temperature & humidity sensor module.
 
Because of the dev board's unusual I2C pinout â€“ used for the OLED display - we need a TwoWire instance with custom pin assignments to pass to the Adafruit_SSD1306 instance.

For the same reason, the Environment library in the Arduino IDE doesn't work for use wth the GY-21 sensor board.
Neither did the SHT21 library. So I modified the latter to have a constructor that allows me to pass the same TwoWire instance that I created for the OLED display. This version is called SHT21_TTGO.

The repo for the SHT21_TTGO library: https://github.com/mspeculatrix/SHT21_TTGO

Display reset pin is 16.
Display I2C address is 0x3C (normally 0x3D for a 128x64 OLED).
  
The code uses lots of Serial.print() statements for debugging purposes. These can be - and probably should be - removed or commented out.

Board to use with Arduino IDE: ESP32 Dev Module

This code uses Adafruit GFX fonts. I've created my own fonts, which are the ones referenced in the code. So it's unlikely you'll be able to run this straight off the bat. Replace the fonts with ones available in your dev environment. Or use the display's built-in fonts.
  
NOTE: Wifi credentials and InfluxDB settings (including credentials) are stored in header files in my Arduino libraries folder. These files are:

WifiCfgHome.h

InfluxDbConfig.h

Samples for both are included in this repo. Edit them and put them in the libraries folder.

In my setup, I have two wifi APs, which is why you see the connection routine alternate between the two in the code and the config header file has two entries. You could always use the same setup and just make both SSIDs the same, if you have only one AP (poor you!).
